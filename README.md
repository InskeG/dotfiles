*These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of my own personal [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/)
that I've decided to share publicly so that others may benefit from them.

These dotfiles are deployed using [dotfiles-framework](https://github.com/zoni/dotfiles-framework).

## Installation

1. `mkdir .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles`
2. `git clone git@github.com:InskeG/dotfiles --recurse-submodules`
3. `ln -s dotfiles/install.sh`
4. `git clone https://github.com/zoni/dotfiles-framework`
5. `sudo cp dotfiles-framework/dotfiles.sh /usr/local/bin`
6. `./install.sh`
